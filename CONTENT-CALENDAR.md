### WEEK 1 TWEETS (10)

**Tweet 1:**
```
90% of insurance denials are reversed on appeal.

Only 15% of people appeal.

Why? Because the process is designed to break you.

That ends now.

Something is coming.
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Insurance companies deny first.

They hope you will not ask questions.

They hope you will pay out of pocket.

They hope you will give up.

They are about to be very disappointed.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Fun fact: Some insurers pay bonuses to employees who deny the most claims.

Your surgery denial just bought someone a new car.

We think that is wrong.

You will too.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
"Not medically necessary"

Four words.

Zero explanation.

100% profit motive.

Every. Single. Time.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
The average appeal takes 8 hours to write.

Most people do not have 8 hours.

Most people have jobs. Kids. Lives.

So they give up. Like they planned.

What if it took 5 minutes instead?
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
48 hours.

That is all I will say for now.

Link in bio.

Turn on notifications.

You do not want to miss this.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
David vs Goliath is a nice story.

But David had a slingshot.

What do you have when the insurance giant denies your MRI?

A stack of forms. A 90-minute hold time. A headache.

That changes Monday.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
Insurance companies have lawyers.

They have doctors on payroll.

They have algorithms that auto-deny claims.

You have... what exactly?

Soon: a fighting chance.
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
Ever wonder why denials always happen on Friday at 4:59pm?

They know you cannot call back until Monday.

They know you will stress all weekend.

They know some people will just pay.

Psychological warfare. Disguised as healthcare.
```

**Tweet 10:**
```
Tomorrow.

9am ET.

Your appeals will never be the same.

@priorauthbuddy

### WEEK 4 TWEETS (10)

**Tweet 1:**
```
This week: Deep dives on specific denial types.

Monday: MRI denials
Tuesday: Surgery denials  
Wednesday: Mental health
Thursday: Prescriptions
Friday: PT denials
Saturday: ER denials

Knowledge is ammunition.

Follow along.
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
MRI denied as "not medically necessary"?

12 ways to fight it:
1. Peer-to-peer requests
2. Functional impairment docs
3. Comparative med failure
4. Specialist referral notes
5. Prior imaging correlation

Buddy knows all 12.

Link in bio.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Surgery denied for "conservative treatment not exhausted"?

Document everything:
- PT dates and outcomes
- Injections tried
- Meds attempted
- Braces used

Show your work. Make them honor the policy language.

Link in bio.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Mental health denials are especially cruel.

Good news: They are also frequently illegal.

Mental Health Parity Act requires equal coverage.

If they cover physical therapy visits, they must cover therapy visits.

Know your rights. Use Buddy. Link in bio.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Prescription denied? Three tactics:

1. Step therapy bypass with adverse reactions
2. Non-formulary exception for clinical need
3. Prior auth with FDA guidelines

Your doctor matters. So does your appeal.

Link in bio.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
Physical therapy capped at 6 visits?

That is not a medical decision. That is a spreadsheet decision.

Request extension with:
- Functional goals status
- Progress reports
- Medical necessity letter

Make them justify the cutoff.

Link in bio.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
ER denials make me angry.

You were scared. In pain. You did the right thing.

Now they Monday-morning quarterback your emergency?

Prudent layperson standard. Look it up. Cite it. Appeal it.

Link in bio.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
The thing about denials:

They are not medical opinions.

They are financial decisions wearing medical costumes.

The costume comes off when you appeal with facts.

Link in bio.
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
Every denial type has a counter-move.

MRI denials need peer reviews.
Surgery denials need conservative tx history.
Mental health needs parity citations.
PT needs functional documentation.

Buddy knows them all.
