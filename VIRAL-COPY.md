## 4. Reddit Post Angles

*For r/insurance, r/healthinsurance, r/personalfinance. NOT promotional. Personal win style.*

### Post 1: The Discovery
**Title:** Just got my denial overturned using an AI appeal tool. Wanted to share for anyone else struggling.

My insurance denied a procedure I desperately needed. I was ready to pay out of pocket because I did not know how to write an appeal. Found this app that generates appeal letters using your denial reason and medical history. Submitted it last Tuesday. Got the approval email this morning. $12,000 covered. If you are dealing with a denial: fight it. Most get overturned. You just need the right words.

---

### Post 2: The PSA
**Title:** PSA: 80% of insurance denials are overturned on appeal. Most people never try because the process seems impossible.

I work in healthcare admin and the stats are wild. Insurers deny first hoping you will give up. Then they approve when you appeal because they know they cannot legally deny it. The problem? Writing an effective appeal is hard if you are not a lawyer. Found an app that generates appeal letters based on your specific denial code. Used it for my wife's MRI denial. Approved in 48 hours. If you got a denial letter: appeal. Always appeal.

---

### Post 3: The Rant-Turned-Rec
**Title:** Insurance denied my insulin pump again. Third time. I am done playing nice.

Been fighting Aetna for months. They deny. I appeal. They deny again. I am not a lawyer. I do not know what magic words make them say yes. Found this app that basically coaches you through the appeal and writes the letter for you. Submitted the appeal it generated. Just got the approval. After 4 months of back and forth an AI letter did it in one try. If you are stuck in denial hell: get help. You do not have to do this alone.

---

### Post 4: The Success Story
**Title:** UPDATE: My $34,000 surgery denial got overturned. Here is what worked.

Original post: [link]. Tons of you DM'd asking how I won the appeal. Honestly? I used an app called PriorAuth Buddy. It analyzed my denial letter and generated an appeal citing the exact state laws the insurer violated. Took 10 minutes. Submitted it. Two weeks later: full approval. Insurance companies bank on you being too overwhelmed to fight. Do not let them win. Use every tool you can.

---

### Post 5: The Question
**Title:** How do you actually write an effective insurance appeal? Every template I find is garbage.

Got denied for physical therapy. My doctor is furious and wrote a letter but the insurer still said no. Looked up appeal templates online and they are all generic nonsense. Has anyone actually won an appeal? What did your letter say? I heard about apps that generate appeals based on your specific denial reason. Anyone tried one? I am desperate and out $8,000 if I cannot get this overturned.

## 5. Twitter/X Thread Starter

*Educational thread. Stats, tips, then the reveal.*

**Tweet 1/5**
Insurance companies deny 1 in 5 claims on first review.

But here is what they do not want you to know:

80% of denials are overturned on appeal.

They are betting you will not fight. Thread on how to beat them.

**Tweet 2/5**
Most people lose appeals because they argue the wrong thing.

You cannot just say "but I need this."

You have to cite:
- Specific policy language they violated
- State insurance regulations
- Medical necessity criteria they ignored

It is a legal game. You need to speak their language.

**Tweet 3/5**
Step 1: Request your denial in writing if you only got a call.

Step 2: Find your state Department of Insurance consumer protections.

Step 3: Quote the exact laws they are breaking in your appeal.

Step 4: CC your state DOI on the appeal.

This terrifies them. They know they are in the wrong.

**Tweet 4/5**
The dirty secret: insurers auto-deny to delay payment.

They know most people will pay out of pocket rather than fight.

Or worse: skip the care they need.

It is profit-driven health denial. And it is legal because people do not know their rights.

**Tweet 5/5**
I got tired of watching people lose to the system.

So I built something:

An AI that reads your denial and writes an appeal citing the exact laws and policy language that win.

It is called PriorAuth Buddy.

Because you should not need a law degree to get healthcare.

## 8. Objection Busters

*For skeptics. Short. Punchy. Factual.*

1. **"An app cannot fight insurance."**
   80% of denials are overturned on appeal. Most people just do not know what to write. Buddy does.

2. **"This sounds like a scam."**
   Your appeal is written based on your actual denial letter and real insurance regulations. No magic. Just the law they hope you do not know.

3. **"My doctor already appealed."**
   Doctors write medical necessity letters. Buddy writes legal appeals citing policy violations and state regulations. Different weapons. Same war.

4. **"Insurance never reverses decisions."**
   They reverse 80% of appealed denials. They just hope you will not appeal. That is the whole business model.

5. **"I cannot afford another subscription."**
   One $4.99 month could save you $5,000, $50,000, or $500,000 in medical bills. Do the math.

## 9. The Origin Story

*Press, About page, TikTok. Real, not corporate. Max 100 words.*

My mom got denied for cancer treatment. The insurance company said it was "experimental" even though three doctors said it was standard care. I watched her spend hours on the phone crying. I watched my dad try to write an appeal letter with zero legal training. They approved it eventually: after we hired a lawyer we could not afford. I built PriorAuth Buddy so no one else has to choose between rent and fighting for their life. You should not need a law degree to get healthcare. You just need Buddy.
