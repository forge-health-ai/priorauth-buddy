# PriorAuth Buddy — Marketing Campaign Plan

## Core Messaging Framework

### Primary Hook
"Insurance companies use AI to deny your claims in seconds. Now you have AI that fights back."

### Talk Tracks (rotate across channels)

**Track 1: The Rage Hook**
"Your insurer denied your claim. They're counting on you to give up. 99% of people do. Be the 1% that fights back."

**Track 2: The AI Weapon**
"They have algorithms. You have Buddy. The first AI companion that studies your insurer's tactics and coaches you to win."

**Track 3: The Numbers**
"200 million claims denied every year. Most are overturned when patients appeal. But less than 1% fight back. Why? Because nobody teaches you how. Until now."

**Track 4: The Chronic Fighter**
"Denied again? If you're fighting the same insurer every 3 months for the same medication, you need a system. Not a template. A fighting partner."

**Track 5: The David vs Goliath**
"UnitedHealthcare uses an AI called nH Predict to auto-deny claims. Their algorithm doesn't read your chart. It just says no. Buddy reads your denial and tells you exactly how to fight it."

**Track 6: The Insider Knowledge**
"Did you know Aetna's denial rate is 26%? Or that Cigna must respond to urgent appeals within 72 hours? Your insurer has rules. Buddy knows every one of them."

**Track 7: The Doctor's Ally**
"Your doctor spends 14 hours a week on prior auth paperwork. Buddy helps you fight the denial so your doctor can focus on treating you."

**Track 8: The Emotional Win**
"She was denied chemo. Three times. She didn't give up. She used Buddy to write her appeal, practiced the call and won. Her insurer approved the treatment in 48 hours."
