**Title:** I built a free app to help track prior authorizations and generate appeal letters

**Body:**
After watching my mom spend weeks fighting a prior auth denial (and eventually winning), I built an app to help.

**What it does:**
- Track your prior auth cases with deadline timers
- Get notified when deadlines approach
- AI generates personalized appeal letters based on your denial reason
- Call scripts so you know exactly what to say when you call insurance

**Why I built it:**
50% of prior auth denials are overturned on appeal. But only 0.2% of people actually appeal. Insurance companies are literally counting on you giving up.

The system is designed to exhaust you. This app fights back.

**Free tier:**
- Track 2 cases
- 1 appeal letter per month
- All call scripts

**Pro ($4.99/mo):**
- Unlimited everything

I'm not trying to get rich off people's misery - I just want to help people fight back. Happy to answer any questions.

## r/ChronicIllness (150K members)

**Title:** Made an app to help fight prior auth denials - because we deal with this more than anyone

**Body:**
If you have a chronic illness, you know the drill. New medication? Prior auth. Refill of the same medication you've been on for years? Prior auth. Want to see a specialist? Prior auth.

And then the denials come.

I built PriorAuth Buddy because I was tired of watching people (including myself) get steamrolled by insurance companies who know most people will just give up.

**The app helps you:**
- Track all your prior auth cases in one place
- See exactly how many days until your deadline
- Generate appeal letters using AI (you just tell it why you were denied)
- Get word-for-word scripts for calling insurance

**The stats that made me build this:**
- 50% of denials are overturned on appeal
- Only 0.2% of people appeal
- Insurance companies KNOW this

They're betting you'll give up. Don't.

Free to try, $4.99/mo for unlimited. Link in comments (don't want this to seem like an ad - just genuinely want to help).

**Title:** Built an app to help patients fight prior auth denials - thought pharmacists might want to share it

**Body:**
I know you all see this every day. Patient comes in, insurance denied the prior auth, they're frustrated, you're frustrated, and there's only so much you can do.

I built a free app called PriorAuth Buddy that helps patients:
- Track their prior auth cases
- Generate appeal letters
- Know what to say when they call insurance

I'm not a pharmacist, but I figured you might want to share this with patients who are struggling. The app is free for basic use.

Would love feedback from people who see prior auth denials all day - what would make this more useful?

## r/Assistance

**Title:** Free app to help people fight insurance denials

**Body:**
Hi everyone. I built a free app to help people fight prior authorization denials from health insurance.

If you've ever had insurance deny a medication or procedure and didn't know what to do, this might help.

**What it does (free):**
- Track up to 2 prior auth cases
- Get 1 AI-generated appeal letter per month
- Access to call scripts (what to say when you call insurance)

**Why it matters:**
50% of insurance denials are overturned when people appeal. But almost nobody does because the system is designed to be confusing and exhausting.

If you or someone you know is dealing with a prior auth denial, I hope this helps.
