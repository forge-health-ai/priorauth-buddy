## Description (4000 chars max)

Insurance companies use AI to deny your claims in seconds. Now you have AI on your side.

Your insurer denied your claim. They're counting on you to give up. Most people do. But you downloaded Buddy.

PriorAuth Buddy is the first AI-powered companion that fights alongside you. Not a chatbot. Not a form letter generator. A real fighting partner that knows your case, studies your insurer's tactics, tracks your deadlines and coaches you through every step of the appeal process.

They have algorithms. Now you have Buddy.

HERE'S WHAT BUDDY DOES:

KNOW YOUR OPPONENT
Buddy has intelligence on every major insurer — their denial rates, common tactics, appeal windows, escalation paths and weaknesses. When you pick your insurance company, Buddy tells you exactly how to beat them. They study you. Now you study them.

AI APPEAL LETTERS
Buddy's AI writes personalized appeal letters based on your specific denial reason, procedure and insurer. Not templates — real letters built from your case details that reference the right regulations and clinical guidelines. What used to take hours now takes seconds.

AI CALL COACH
Terrified to call your insurance company? Practice first. Buddy's AI plays the insurance rep while you rehearse. Get real-time coaching on exactly what to say, when to push back and how to stay calm. Walk into that call prepared.

PHONE SCRIPTS
Know exactly what to say before you pick up the phone. Scripts for every scenario — "That's our policy," "You can appeal," "We need more documentation" — with proven responses that work.

DEADLINE TRACKING
Never miss an appeal window. Buddy calculates your deadlines based on your insurer's rules and sends push notifications before time runs out. Most plans give you 30-180 days. Every day counts.

STATE-SPECIFIC RIGHTS
Your rights depend on where you live. Buddy shows you your state's appeal deadlines, insurance department contact info and the public regulations that protect you. One tap to file a complaint.

DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
Log every call with your insurer — who you spoke with, what they said, reference numbers. Build the paper trail that wins appeals. Share your appeal letter directly with your doctor for review and signature.

AI DENIAL SCANNER
Take a photo of your denial letter and Buddy's AI reads it instantly. Extracts the insurer name, procedure, denial reason and appeal deadline so you can start fighting immediately. No more decoding insurance jargon.

THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE:
- Insurance companies deny over 200 million claims per year
- Most denials are overturned when patients appeal
- Less than 1% of patients actually fight back
- The system is designed to make you quit

Be the 1% that fights.

BUDDY GROWS WITH YOU
The more you fight, the stronger Buddy gets. Start as a Rookie and earn your way to Legend status through real wins. Eight evolution ranks that track your victories, insurers beaten and appeals filed.

PRO FEATURES ($4.99/month):
- Unlimited cases (free tier: 1 case)
- AI appeal letter generation
- AI denial analysis
- Call Coach practice sessions
- Priority support

Your first case is always free. Try Buddy, see if it works for you, then decide.

They use AI to say no. Now you use AI to fight back.

Built by people who got denied too. We know how it feels.
